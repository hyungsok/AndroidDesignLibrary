    <string name="second_activity_text">In the above, we use the CollapsingToolbarLayout with the scroll and exitUntilCollapsed flags which will make its subviews scroll off screen. For the Toolbar however, we set app:layout_collapseMode="pin" which will ensure that the Toolbar itself remains pinned to the top of the screen while the view collapses. Another effect we’ll get is that the title in the CollapsingToolbarLayout will appear larger when the layout is fully visible, then transition to its default size as it is collapsed. We’ll set this title in code. The rest of the layout contains a NestedScrollView with several Cards as its children.</string>
